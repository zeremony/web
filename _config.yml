  desc: Zeremony is a Hard Rock Band from Germany and was formed in November 2015 in WÃ¼rzburg, Bavaria. With the heavy hammond organ drive from Daniel, the grooves of drummer Frank, the fuzzy Guitar tone and dynamic vocals by Ilja, the trio carries on the hard rock tradition in the vein of the early seventies.
